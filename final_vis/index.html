    <h4 class="child">Historically, women have been left in the shadows, their stories and labor hidden behind their male counterparts.
      <br>
      <br>
      Through this visualization, we see that in film, it is no different. Portrayal of social movements in mass media shapes and is shaped by popular attitude towards those movements.
      <br>
      <br>
      Visualized data about movies lends insight on how culture and media cross-influence each other. Through the lens of feminist waves beginning in the 19th century, all the way to 2017, we see how women’s place in movies has metamorphised,
      sculpted by the women fighting for equality within each wave.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Disclaimer:</b> While this visualization is rooted in feminism and women’s movements, the dataset classifies gender as two distinct categories represented in a binary fashion. We want to acknowledge that gender is a spectrum and more nuanced
      than what is represented in these visualizations.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 class="child">While people have been debating women’s place in the world since the beginning of time, the first wave of feminism signifies the West’s first major sustained political movement predicated on attaining political equality for
      women. Significant events include the Seneca Falls Convention and the ratification of the 19th amendment, securing women's suffrage.
      <br>
      <br>
      Further, the film industry really took off during the first wave, and slowly but surely, we begin to see more women appear in films across the wave’s timeframe.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 class="child">The second wave of feminism was focused on broader social issues including domestic violence, sexual harassment, reproductive rights, equality in the workplace, and portrayal in media. It changed the way society saw women.
      Between the first and second wave, the United States experienced the Great Depression, World War II, and the economic boom following the war.
      <br>
      <br>
      Films at this time often portrayed women as dependent on men, and often in supporting roles and mothers and housewives. Feminists, however, were often showcased as angry and man-hating, haunting the legacy of feminism into the third wave.
      <br>
      <br>
      Many legal advances were made as well, such as FDA approval of contraceptive pills allowed women to remain in the workplace for longer, Title VII in Civil Rights Act, Equal Pay Act, Roe v. Wade and Griswold v. Connecticut.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 class="child">The Third wave was born out of the civil-rights movement and other advances of the second wave. Women involved in the third wave had a heightened awareness of the obstacles presented to them by sexism, racism and classism. They
      fought the patriarchy through grassroots activism.
      <br>
      <br>
      Third-wave feminists sought to question and redefine the ideas around womanhood, beauty, gender, sexuality, femininity, and masculinity. They examined layers of oppression and intersectionality, and deeply embraced individualism and diversity,
      ultimately revamping what it meant to be a feminist. In terms of film, the narrative of women and girls portrayed became stronger, more empowered, less apologetic than in any films the world had seen before.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 class="child"> Collectively, we aimed to visualize how far we are from ideal gender equality in film. The below visualizations allow for further exploration into films and the feminist movement through the lens of greater intersectionality.
      For example, you can filter by ‘African American’, ‘Lesbian’, ‘Transgender’ and more.
      <br>
      <br>
      Mainstream western feminism has often left out women of color, LGBTQ individuals and others, despite their vast and invaluable work for women’s movements. We look forward to a time where the intersectionality of feminism in film is both
      represented and celebrated.
      <br>
      <br>
      The thing about waves is that they absorb more energy and grow stronger as they move, and we’re confident that women will continue gathering strength for time to come.
